What is remote repo? --> a storage area on the internet

Tracking our first project
Create a new project in intellij and in order to start tracking it follow the steps:
1. Find the location of your project (
2. Decide the location where
3. Navigate your terminal to the location of your project
 Initialize the repo:
1. git init

 Stage architecture:
Working directory - all the files that you have in your project
Staging area - an area between the repo and the working directory. Here the snapshot of all the files are moved
before actually moving them to repo - the advantage is that you can easily change the files there
Repo - actual storage area

Steps of tracking
git status --> untracked files that are in staging area nut not in repo yet.
It doesn't tell us about files in staging area wich are also in repo

Before making a commit make sure you really want to do it

Github:
1 for each local repo you need to have unique individual remote repo!!!
2. Make sure you check the connection before. Use gir remote -v If empty, it is not connected
3. git remote add origin Place the url of the remote repo
4. git branch -M main (naming your branch)
